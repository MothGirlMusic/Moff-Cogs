# Say

This is the Say cog, which allows you to make your bot send text or event upload images. It can also be used as a bridge in DM so you can see what the bot sees, and give him messages to send.

## Installation and quick start

`[p]` is your prefix.

1.  Install the repo if it's not already done.
    ```
    [p]repo add Moff-Cogs https://github.com/MothGirlMusic/Moff-Cogs/
    ```

2.  Install and load Say
    ```py
    [p]cog install Moff-Cogs say
    # Type "I agree" if requested
    # wait for your bot to install the cog
    [p]load say
    ```

Say is now installed!

## Examples

### say and saydelete

```
[p]say Hello I'm a bot
[p]say #general Hello I'm still a bot, and nobody saw anyone send a command :3
[p]saydelete Hi, nobody had the time to see who typed the command since I deleted it!
[p]say Look at this beautiful Pok√©mon (you can attach a file to your message, not higher than 8mb)
```

### interact

```
[p]interact #testing
```

Messages sent in #testing will be sent to you in DM. Whatever you say to the bot in DM will be sent in #testing too.
